# Admin page for my portfolio

## What is this?

This is the code for the admin page to update my portfolio. You can see the adminpage live here: http://charlotteranemo.se/pAdmin

If you want to see my portfolio, you can go to: http://charlotteranemo.se or view its source code here: https://github.com/charlotteranemo/portfolio

## How does it work?

This page uses the REST API that I have created which you can find the code to here: https://github.com/charlotteranemo/portfolio-rest

This admin page uses Webpack for builds, just like the main portfolio. Webpack transpiles the SCSS code I have written into CSS and adds it to the site. Clone the code and run a npm install followed by a npm start to see the code in action.
